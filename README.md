Writing pieces that I don't know where else to put.

Hi. If you're here, you've succeeded in finding my *lair*, so to speak. I do not consider myself a writer by trade, but nevertheless, I write. I have written many things, across many years. But do not presume any of it to have been read before. Alas, *you* might be the first person reading what I've written.

What a scary thought. 

But after years of holding onto these things myself, I have decided they needed to be shared, however anonymously. Please do leave a note if it so inclines you. I'd love to hear your thoughts.
